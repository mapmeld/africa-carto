When I was at an exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum last year, I took pictures of a
few Africa maps. I wondered, how might the maps be different if they used a
non-Mercator projection. Would the difference be noticeable? Where could the
curators go to quickly create such a map?

You can use this repo to create your own diverse Africa maps, or as a tutorial
in cartography, D3, and MapBoxGL.
