When I was at an exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum last year, I took pictures of a
few Africa maps. I wondered, how might the maps be different if they used a
non-Mercator projection. Would the difference be noticeable? Where could the
curators go to quickly create such a map? Now that some time has passed, and I
no longer work for a rival museum, I'd like to re-make these maps on the web
and see how they would look.

You can use this repo to create your own cartography, or as a tutorial
in cartography, D3, and MapBoxGL.
